**Location:** Found in multiple locations across the website including:
- Homepage footer (App download section)
- /app page
- /about-us/contact-us/scam-alerts/

**Link:** `javascript:void(0)`  
**Status:** Not a broken link but non-functional for accessibility

## Console Errors Observed

During page load, the following errors were detected:

These errors don't affect primary functionality but should be investigated for optimal performance.

## Conclusion

The Dominos Australia website is generally well-maintained with only **one critical broken link** - the outdated iTunes App Store URL. This should be fixed immediately as it appears on multiple pages and directly impacts user acquisition via the iOS app.

All other tested links (30+ unique URLs) are functioning correctly, indicating good overall link health for the website.
